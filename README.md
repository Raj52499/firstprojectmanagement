Q4)*Issue Title:** "App crashes on startup after update"
- Linked to Milestone: "Beta Release Preparation"
- Reason for Linking: This bug must be fixed before we can move forward with the beta release. The app cannot be released for testing if it crashes immediately upon opening.
- 
Issue Title: "Add dark mode toggle in settings"
- Linked to Milestone: "Beta Release Preparation"
- Reason for Linking: The dark mode feature is a major enhancement requested by users and is essential for improving user experience. Having this feature implemented before the beta release ensures that the product is well-received and user-friendly.

Q5)Using GitHub’s project management features, such as milestones, issues, and project boards, greatly enhances team collaboration and project organization. The use of **milestones** helps the team focus on clear objectives, setting deadlines and delivering specific features or fixes within a given time frame. Linking issues to milestones ensures that tasks are prioritized and aligned with the broader goals of the project, making it easier to track progress toward major releases.

The **issue tracker** allows for efficient communication and problem resolution by documenting bugs, feature requests, and tasks clearly. This minimizes confusion, especially in large teams, as each issue can be assigned to the appropriate person and its status can be tracked.

**Project boards** provide a visual representation of the project's progress, which is essential for team transparency. Having columns for "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" helps everyone stay informed about what tasks are upcoming, which are actively being worked on, and which are completed.

However, challenges may arise when managing larger projects with many issues. Keeping the project board organized and ensuring all team members update the status of their tasks regularly can be time-consuming. Additionally, coordinating between team members on which issues to prioritize might lead to some initial disagreements or delays, especially if there are conflicting opinions on which features or bugs are more urgent.

Despite these challenges, I believe that the structure provided by GitHub’s project management tools will ultimately improve our team's workflow, increase accountability, and streamline communication, making it easier to meet deadlines and deliver a successful project.
